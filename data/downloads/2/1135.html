<p>Do you want a diamond that sparkles on your fiancée's finger? (Who doesn't!) If so, the first thing to know when shopping for an engagement ring is that <b>cut is the most important</b>. </p>
<p>Out of the 4c's (cut, color, clarity, and carat), the cut has the biggest impact on the diamond's appearance. A well-cut diamond can hide surface imperfections and discoloration, and can even make it appear shinier and bigger.</p>
<p>Are you convinced? Unfortunately, a good cut is also the hardest to obtain as it requires extreme skill and precision. A lot of diamond retailers that claim to sell ideal cut diamonds are in fact... not so ideal.</p>
<p>This means you need to be careful when shelling out the dough for a high cut diamond. For a diamond retailer that delivers, we recommend you have a browse at Whiteflash. </p>
<p>Whiteflash is known for their A CUT ABOVE® diamonds, which are considered <b>world-class, super ideal cut diamonds</b>, having been skillfully made to extremely high standards. In fact, Whiteflash is so confident in the quality of their diamonds that you get <b>detailed light performance images and reports for every single diamond</b>. This information proves the superior quality of their diamonds. </p>
<p><a href="engagement-ring-online.html">Buying an engagement ring</a> is a serious commitment, not only emotionally but financially. CreditDonkey wants to make sure that you're getting your money's worth wherever you decide to buy. We've carefully reviewed several other top online diamond sellers, so you've come to the right place. </p>
<p>Keep reading to find out how Whiteflash stacks up against the competition. </p>
<h3 class='underline'><b>6 Reasons That Make Whiteflash a Standout</b></h3>
<p>At first glance, one <a href="best-place-buy-engagement-ring-online.html">online engagement ring retailer</a> may look the same as any other, but they each have their individual advantages that set them apart.</p>
<p>Here is what makes Whiteflash stand out from the competition. </p>
<p><ol><li><b>Super ideal cut diamonds.</b> Whiteflash houses one of the largest inventories of super ideal cut diamonds. Whiteflash prides itself on being the exclusive developer and sole distributor of A CUT ABOVE® Super Ideal diamonds. We'll explain how Whiteflash determines which diamonds meet that high standard in more detail below.  </p>
<p><li><b>Exceptional quality control.</b> Whiteflash is ISO 9000 certified, meaning it meets international industry standards for quality. Jewelers who obtain this certification are required to follow strict quality control measures, so you can rest assured that the diamond you're buying is represented accurately.  </p>
<p><li><b>Exceptional data provided.</b> Whiteflash stocks their own diamonds (as opposed to other online retailers who only have a virtual inventory, such as <a href="blue-nile-review.html">Blue Nile</a>). This means that every in-house diamond sold by Whiteflash is subject to light performance imaging, analysis, and visual inspection. </p>
<p>Buyers are presented with a full lab report detailing the results. You can actually view the same images that Whiteflash's trained gemologists saw before you commit to a ring. This is extremely rare for any diamond seller (whether in store or online).</p>
<p><table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' border='0' class='image ' width='550' style=''><tr><td><img src="image/1/550w/whiteflash-data.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Whiteflash Diamond" title="Screenshot of Whiteflash Diamond " width="550" height="286" border='0' /></a></td></tr><tr><td class='metaInline'>Screenshot of Whiteflash Diamond</td></tr></table></p>
<p>Every single in-house diamond comes with an Idealscope image, ASET image, and hearts and arrows image (explained more in detail later). All these images can be blown up so you can really examine them. These images show the light return of the diamond and its symmetry. You can also even see an HD video of how sparkly the diamond is. </p>
<p>You will also receive the diamond certificate from America Gem Society Laboratories (AGSL) and a Sarin grading report.</p>
<p>You are literally getting everything that trained gemologists saw (except for actually viewing the stone yourself). It is very rare to receive all this information, even when shopping at a brick-and-mortar store.</p>
<p><li><b>Diamonds for all budgets.</b> WhiteFlash offers three tiers of diamonds:</p>
<p><ul><li><b>A CUT ABOVE®</b>, which is their signature line of super ideal cut diamonds. These diamonds have been cut to the most ideal angles and proportions, which means perfect symmetry and light performance. As a result, this is the most expensive line, but you're pretty much guaranteed perfection. A CUT ABOVE® diamonds are available in round or princess cut.</p>
<p><li><b>Expert Selection</b> are diamonds that almost made it into A CUT ABOVE®. Expert Selection diamonds still have the highest grade for cut at either AGS or GIA, but fall short of Whiteflash's strict internal requirements for A CUT ABOVE®. The normal person, though, won't be able to tell the difference. This selection offers a good balance of price and quality.</p>
<p><li><b>Premium Selection</b> is great for those more on a budget. These are diamonds that may have less perfect polish or symmetry, more light leakage, or less defined hearts and arrows. It's not to say that these diamonds aren't good. Whiteflash's requirements are very strict, so even small (technical) reasons could put a diamond into this category. But the good news for you is that you'll get great value with this selection. </ul></p>
<p><table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' border='0' class='image ' width='550' style=''><tr><td><img src="image/1/550w/whiteflash-tiers.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Whiteflash Diamond Tiers" title="Screenshot of Whiteflash Diamond Tiers " width="550" height="169" border='0' /></a></td></tr><tr><td class='metaInline'>Screenshot of Whiteflash Diamond Tiers</td></tr><tr><td class='shortdesc'>Idealscope images for randomly selected Premium, Expert, and A Cut Above diamonds. You can see that the Premium diamond has a lot more white in the image, which means more light leakage. The A Cut Above diamond is almost perfect.</td></tr></table></p>
<p>Shoppers can also create a custom design of their own. You could go nuts and get a diamond with perfect hearts and arrows symmetry, or you could get a tiny, tiny one (0.3 carat) while keeping your wallet in decent shape.</p>
<p><li><b>Ethically sourced diamonds.</b> Whiteflash stands by its commitment to sell ethically sourced diamonds. Every stone is sourced in accordance with the Kimberley Process, a program developed to counteract the conflict diamond trade in South Africa. In addition, Whiteflash is a member of the United Nations Global Compact and Diamond Development Initiative.</p>
<p><li><b>Highly trained staff.</b> If you're worried about buying an engagement ring from someone who's clueless about diamonds, have no fear. Whiteflash's entire staff is GIA-trained (Gemological Institute of America), so they know their stuff. </ol></p>
<h3 class='underline'><b>A CUT ABOVE® Diamonds</b></h3>
<p>We've already briefly explained why cut is extremely important. Getting just the right cut requires specialized skills, patience and an eye for precision. A perfectly cut diamond will have perfect symmetry, proportions, and polish. And optimized light performance - fire and brilliance.</p>
<p>Whiteflash's "A CUT ABOVE®" is their line of super ideal cut diamonds. The cut standard is extremely strict and only diamonds that meet all the requirements make it into this line. Every diamond is analyzed at the American Gem Society Laboratories (AGSL). To be A CUT ABOVE®, it has to receive AGSL Triple Ideal, which means it's earned a rating of AGS0 in each of the three areas of light performance, polish, and symmetry. </p>
<p>Whiteflash is especially proud of their <b>round "hearts and arrows" diamonds</b>. This means that the diamond has a perfectly lined up pattern of hearts and arrows (H&A) when viewed through an H&A viewer (you'll see arrows when viewing down from the top, and hearts when looking from the bottom). </p>
<p>When you see a diamond with well-defined and completely symmetrical hearts and arrows, it means that the <b>diamond has been cut and polished to the perfect ideal angles and proportions</b>. If a diamond has perfect hearts, it'll have perfect arrows too. Only about 1% of diamonds in the world can be truly called "hearts and arrows" diamonds. A perfect pattern of Hearts and Arrows means that all the facets are aligned properly in three dimensions and the diamond is perfectly "tuned" for light performance.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a <a href="http://www.whiteflash.com/loose-diamonds/round-cut-loose-diamond-3646312.htm" rel="nofollow">randomly selected</a> A CUT ABOVE® diamond to illustrate the point:</p>
<p><table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' border='0' class='image ' width='550' style=''><tr><td><img src="image/1/550w/whiteflash-cut-above.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Whiteflash Cut Above Diamond" title="Screenshot of Whiteflash Cut Above Diamond " width="550" height="169" border='0' /></a></td></tr><tr><td class='metaInline'>Screenshot of Whiteflash Cut Above Diamond</td></tr><tr><td class='shortdesc'>Images from Idealscope, ASET scope, and H&amp;A viewer</td></tr></table></p>
<p>As you can see, this randomly selected diamond has a clear and nearly perfect symmetry of hearts and arrows, with no light leakage. </p>
<p>Many other diamond dealers may claim their diamond is an H&A diamond, but you can never be sure unless you get the images. If a diamond seller refuses to show their imagery, then you'd want to beware. Since Whiteflash provides this information for every in-house diamond, including A CUT ABOVE®, you can look around and be completely confident in exactly what you're getting. They also provide information for virtual diamonds after bringing it in for evaluation</p>
<p>Because of the precise work involved and that more raw material is lost during the process than for the other diamonds, <b>A CUT ABOVE® diamonds are more costly</b>. But you can be sure that you're getting the best of the best, and there is absolutely no guesswork as to what you will receive.</p>
<h3 class='underline'><b>Returns, Buy Backs, and Other Things to Know</b></h3>
<p><ul><li><b>Service guarantee</b>: Diamonds are meant to last forever, but wear and tear can affect the metals that hold them in place. Luckily, Whiteflash includes a one-year service plan for each ring it sells, which covers refinishing and repairs for the metals and accent diamonds. </p>
<p><li><b>Lifetime trade-ups</b>: If at some point your significant other decides they'd like a different diamond, you can simply swap out their existing stone for a new one that's worth the same amount or more. You can trade up at any time if you purchased one of Whiteflash's in-house diamonds or a designer engagement ring and have held onto the original diamond laboratory certificate.  Lifetime trade up on all Whiteflash in-house diamonds is 100% of purchase price. For designer engagement rings, it's 50%.</p>
<p><li><b>Designer engagement rings</b>: Whiteflash is an authorized distributor for Tacori, Simon G, Verragio, Ritani, Danhov, and Benchmark.</p>
<p><li><b>Money back guarantee</b>: In the event you need to return the diamond, you have a complete satisfaction full money back guarantee to return the diamond for a full refund during the first 30 days.</p>
<p><li><b>One-year buyback option</b>: What happens after the 30 days are up? If you end up calling off your nuptials or you need to return your engagement ring for any reason, Whiteflash will buy it back within one year of the original purchase date. That benefit applies to in-house diamonds and you'll get back 70% of what you paid, as long as it's in its original condition.</p>
<p><li><b>Extra rewards</b>: If you're super satisfied with your Whiteflash purchase, be sure to tell as many friends as you can about it. Every time you refer a friend and they make a purchase, you'll get a check for $100. You'll also get a $100 loyalty discount for being a repeat customer every time you spend $2,000 or more on new jewelry purchases. </ul></p>
<h3 class='underline'><b>3 Reasons to Shop for a Ring Elsewhere</b></h3>
<p>Whiteflash certainly has some benefits but, like other diamond retailers we've reviewed, it's not perfect. Here are some reasons why Whiteflash may not be the best fit for you. </p>
<p><ol><li><b>In-house inventory only has round or princess cuts </b><br />Whiteflash has a pretty decent size of in-house inventory, but you'll only find round or princess cuts (which are their specialties). They have one of the largest inventory of in-house certified ideal cut diamonds of any retail jeweler. If this is what you're looking for, then you can't find anywhere better that provides such detailed information.</p>
<p>If you're looking for another shape, they do have an extensive virtual inventory that comes from third-party suppliers. While in-house diamonds have images posted upfront, for virtual diamonds, the detailed images are provided after Whiteflash had a chance to bring it in for evaluation.</p>
<p><li><b>Shorter return window for virtual inventory</b><br />Another potential snag centers on the return policy for diamonds purchased from the virtual inventory. While you have up to 30 days to return an in-house diamond for a full refund, you only have 10 days to send back one from the virtual inventory. If you're buying your engagement ring well in advance of popping the question, that could be a complication if the proposal doesn't work out or your future spouse doesn't love the ring. </p>
<p><li><b>No lifetime warranty </b><br />Whiteflash's one-year service plan is pretty generous, but it really limits you if something happens to the ring beyond that point. Other online diamond stores offer a lifetime warranty that covers things like refinishing, cleaning and prong tightening to help keep your ring in top-notch condition. But keep in mind, many of the "lifetime warranties" have strict restrictions and requirements to follow.</ol></p>
<h3 class='underline'><b>How It Compares</b></h3>
<p>To wrap up our review, we've compared Whiteflash to two other virtual engagement ring heavy hitters. <a href="james-allen-review.html">James Allen</a> and <a href="blue-nile-review.html">Blue Nile</a> both have their strong points, so read on for the details. </p>
<p><b>Whiteflash vs James Allen</b>:<br />James Allen offers GIA-certified diamonds, but they do something Whiteflash doesn't. Buyers who shop James Allen are treated to their trademarked "Diamond Display Technology," which offers a 360-degree, high-definition view of every diamond in their collection. Whiteflash does post 360 HD diamond videos on all their in-house diamonds. Whiteflash will provide 360 HD videos on virtual diamonds at the time of their evaluation.</p>
<p>James Allen also has a wider selection of diamond shapes. But it doesn't provide the Idealscope, ASET, or H&A imagery, so you're only looking at the diamond's appearance. You can however, request an Idealscope image from a customer service rep. </p>
<p>James Allen provides 24/7 customer support, making it so you can always get a rep on the line if you have a problem with your purchase. Whiteflash customers are limited to making calls during regular business hours, Monday through Friday. </p>
<p>Another area where James Allen shines is their financing options. A ring can easily run several thousand dollars but if you don't have the cash, you can finance it interest-free for six months or pay a low interest rate with a two-year payment plan. Whiteflash only offers six-month 0% APR financing for in-store purchases. If you're buying online, you'll only have 90 days to pay it off before the interest kicks in. </p>
<p><b>Whiteflash vs Blue Nile</b>:<br />Blue Nile claims to offer the largest collection of diamonds online, but you'll have to browse through yourself to decide whether you like Whiteflash's diamonds better. While all diamonds are fully certified, one area where Blue Nile loses out is the fact it doesn't include an actual image of individual stones on its website. If you're looking for a super ideal cut diamond, Blue Nile does have a Signature Line, which is their finest cut diamonds. Some have an actual photo, but you won't get the Idealscope, ASET, or H&A imagery.</p>
<p>One thing that does set it apart, though, is the fact that Blue Nile sells colored diamonds. If you want to present your sweetheart with a yellow or pink diamond instead of something more traditional, you won't be able to find that at Whiteflash. </p>
<p>Finally, there's the buyback program. Blue Nile partners with Mondiamo to sponsor the program and the amount you'll get back is based on the ring's value, not what you paid. If your Blue Nile ring depreciates in value, it could shortchange the amount you'd get from a buyback. Whiteflash, on the other hand, guarantees to give you at least 70% of the purchase price. </p>
<h3 class='underline'><b>The Bottom Line</b></h3>
<p>If you are willing and able to pony up for the ideal super cut of Whiteflash's best diamonds, you will be hard-pressed to find a more perfect rock than their A CUT ABOVE® diamonds.</p>
<p>But even if not, you can be confident in Whiteflash's stringent quality standards. The normal eye would not be able to differentiate between their A CUT ABOVE® and their Expert Selection diamonds. You can even find some real gems for a good value in the Premium Selection. </p>
<p>Whiteflash also stands out by providing the Idealscope, ASET, and H&A images for every single in-house diamond. This is not offered by most other diamond sellers; it takes the guesswork out and you can purchase with complete confidence. The only downside is that this is only available upfront for round and princess cut diamonds. For virtual diamonds, they will get the light performance imagery after Whiteflash has brought in the diamond for evaluation.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Whiteflash is a top-quality site and you can find a superlative diamond here, no matter how large or small your budget is. Just make sure you've got the cash to buy the ring outright or a credit card with an introductory <a href="0-purchases.html">0% APR on purchases</a> to cover the cost since Whiteflash's 90-day online financing option leaves something to be desired. </p>
